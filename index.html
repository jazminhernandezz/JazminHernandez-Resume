        <p class="lead mb-4">My major is education because my goal was to become a teacher. I am hoping to be able to teach kids in elementary. There are many things I have done such as volunteer work and tutoring. I have also been a tutor for a program named AVID in order to get more familiar with working with kids. I have done a lot of teaching jobs that have given me more experience and knowledge about working with children.  <br><br>

        I have done volunteer work by working at schools in the after school programs. We would help them with anything they needed to do, do activities with them in order to help them release some stress. We also had short breaks outside so that they could get their energy out and not feel trapped inside the whole time. The after school programs lasted about one to two hours every week day. This program was for those who had both parents working, so they left them with us while they finished work and got home. This was their way of making sure their kids were not alone and bored at home. I have also volunteered and become a teacher's assistant in previous schools that I have attended. Working as a teachers assistant has definitely taught me a lot about how the environment is working with children. I have also coached activities such as sports, and fundraisers. This allowed me to gain more personal connections with the kids. I have planned activities for them, and planned other fun stuff. Some stuff I helped plan was arts and crafts, soccer games, kickball games, and more. I have helped them study, do homework, or work on classwork. These activities were a way to learn more about what kids enjoy and learn more about them in general. 
<br><br>

        I have also had the opportunity to babysit my nephews in order to gain more experience with dealing with kids. Babysitting and taking care of my nephews has allowed me to learn more about how children learn and need to be taught. For example, I would help them with their homework or any class work that they would not understand. I have had many jobs working with children and have been able to help them with school. I have also worked at a day care which allowed me to spend more time with kids and learn more about how to work with them. In my daycare experience I was fortunate enough to be able to care for these kids for the majority of the day. Not only has this work experience been fun, but it has also taught me some key things about working with kids. I think I have had a fair amount of experience working with children, so that I now know I am ready to become a teacher. Teaching has always been a passion of mine and I am very grateful to be able to pursue this. I have had a lot of experience as of now, but teaching would be the final step in my journey of becoming an educator.
